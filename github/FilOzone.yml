  github-mgmt approvers:
    # Notes:
    # 1. These members have triage access to the github-mgmt repository.
    # 2. These members + github-mgmt-stewards + org owners are who can approve PRs to this repo.
    # 3. These members can't merge PRs.  They need a github-mgmt-stewards or org owner to do this.
    # 4. Having a team instead of direct collaborators on the github-mgmt repository also enables easy reference in the github-mgmt CODEOWNERS file.
    # ATTN: members are expected to:
    #  - be familiar with github-mgmt / github-as-code
    #  - be ready to triage/review org configuration change requests in github-mgmt
    {}
  github-mgmt stewards:
    # Notes:
    # 1. These members have push+ access to the github-mgmt repository (in addition to the org owners listed in "members.admin" above).
    # 2. Having a team instead of direct collaborators on the github-mgmt repository also enables easy reference in the github-mgmt CODEOWNERS file.
    members:
      # WARN: membership here should be treated as cautiously as having an "org owner" role,
      # since one can escalate their privileges accordingly.
      # ATTN: members are expected to:
      #  - be familiar with github-mgmt / github-as-code
      #  - be ready to triage/review org configuration change requests in github-mgmt
      # INFO: There are others who could certainly qualify to be members of this team.
      # There is a balance to be had to ensure there are enough knowledgeable people available to support the needs/requests of the github org,
      # and reducing risk by not having too many with the escalation path that this role affords.
      # INFO: Intentionally minimize "maintainers" so that additional membership is done through github-mgmt rather than the GitHub UI.
      # INFO: The individuals below are listed as "maintainers" rather than "members" because they are FilOzone owners/admins (see "org.admin" above).
      # GitHub will auto-bump their team privileges anyway if we don't manually.
      maintainer:
        # Why @BigLep?
        # 1. This can be temporarily, but at least of 2024-08-02, he is contracted with FilOz to get github-mgmt setup and operationalized
        #    (e.g., https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/710).
        # 2. He has experience working with github-mgmt in other contexts (e.g., ipfs per https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/issues/511)
        - BigLep
        # Why @galargh?
        # 1. Same reasons listed at the top in "members.admin".
        # 2. He has deep knowledge of the tool and its use as the creator.  This empowers him to help make changes and improvements in a low friction way.
        - galargh
        # Why @jennijuju?
        # 1. Same reasons listed at the top in "members.admin".
        # 2. She is part of the team rather than just relying on "org.admin" abilities so she sees the @FilOzone/github-mgmt-stewards team mentions/notifications.
        - jennijuju
      member:
        # Why @rjan90?
        # 1. He is a project manager at FilOz.
        - rjan90
        # Why @rvagg?
        # 1. He is an active in-the-GitHub-trenches maintainer for FilOz, often touching the 10+ repos that FilOz owns/maintains.
        #    FilOz wants to ensure changes to these repos is done under code review and transparently,
        #    and @rvagg is one of the key people who will be reviewing these changes.
        #    (FilOz is also guinea-pigging this process, but the hope/intent is to have other groups manage their repos in this way too if its successful.
        #    We are also dependent on some tooling improvement to support a diverse set of stakeholders that have limited blast radius.
        #    See https://github.com/ipdxco/github-as-code/issues/126 for more info.)
        # 2. He has experience working with github-mgmt in other contexts (e.g., ipld)
