    members:
      # WARN: membership here should be treated as cautiously as having an "org owner" role,
      # since one can escalate their privileges accordingly.
      # ATTN: members are expected to:
      #  - be familiar with github-mgmt / github-as-code
      #  - be ready to triage/review org configuration change requests in github-mgmt
      # INFO: There are others who could certainly qualify to be members of this team.
      # There is a balance to be had to ensure there are enough knowledgeable people available to support the needs/requests of the github org,
      # and reducing risk by not having too many with the escalation path that this role affords.
      # INFO: Intentionally minimize "maintainers" so that additional membership is done through github-mgmt rather than the GitHub UI.
      # INFO: The individuals below are listed as "maintainers" rather than "members" because they are FilOzone owners/admins (see "org.admin" above).

        #    (e.g., https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/710).
        # 2. He has experience working with github-mgmt in other contexts (e.g., ipfs per https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/issues/511)

        # Why @galargh?
        # 1. Same reasons listed at the top in "members.admin".
        # 2. He has deep knowledge of the tool and its use as the creator.  This empowers him to help make changes and improvements in a low friction way.
        - galargh
        # Why @jennijuju?
        # 1. Same reasons listed at the top in "members.admin".
        # 2. She is part of the team rather than just relying on "org.admin" abilities so she sees the @FilOzone/github-mgmt-stewards team mentions/notifications.
        - jennijuju
        - rjan90
      member:
        # Why @rjan90?
        # 1. He is a project manager at FilOz.
        # Why @rvagg?
        # 1. He is an active in-the-GitHub-trenches maintainer for FilOz, often touching the 10+ repos that FilOz owns/maintains.
        #    FilOz wants to ensure changes to these repos is done under code review and transparently,
        #    and @rvagg is one of the key people who will be reviewing these changes.
        #    (FilOz is also guinea-pigging this process, but the hope/intent is to have other groups manage their repos in this way too if its successful.
        #    We are also dependent on some tooling improvement to support a diverse set of stakeholders that have limited blast radius.
        #    See https://github.com/ipdxco/github-as-code/issues/126 for more info.)
        # 2. He has experience working with github-mgmt in other contexts (e.g., ipld)
